    // This is kind of a dirty hack. Here's the deal.
    // In order to simulate real world agent runs, we need to sleep 30 minutes
    // in between each series of agent requests. That can be achieved
    // easily by adding a "pause" to the end of the run.
    // However, if we do that, then after the final series of requests, we'll sleep
    // for 30 minutes before the simulation can end, even though that is entirely
    // unnecessary. Since most of our jenkins jobs are going to run 2-6 sims,
    // that would mean we're sleeping for 1-3 extra hours and uselessly tying up the
    // hardware. Thus, we need to make the sleep conditional based on whether
    // or not we're on the final repetition.
    // Here we've replaced our "pause" with a Gatling "session function",
    // which basically just sets a session variable to check to see if
    // we are on the final repetition, and if not, sleep for 30 mins.
    //
    // In addition, simply sleeping for sleepDuration after a run causes issues
    // long runs, where start/end times will drift, and agent runs will start to
    // clump together. To solve this, the length of the pause is calculated to
    // be the difference between (start time + (repetition * sleep duration))
    // and the current time.
    //
    // That is, if the sleep duration is 30 seconds, and a run takes 5 seconds,
    // the agent will sleep for 25 seconds
